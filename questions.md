* Can you provide a brief description of the Signature Creation and Verification algorithms? Which one takes more time?
* Why is it important to have a "unique K"? What vulnerabilities can be exploited if K is known to be reused? Can you provide a real-life example of when such an exploit occurred?

## Week 3: Chapter 4 (Serialization) + Chapter 5 (Transactions)

* What is the Wallet Import Format (WIF) used for, and how is it generated from a private key?
* How is the compressed SEC format serialised for a point P = (x,y)?
* Briefly outline the process of creating a Bitcoin address. Which hash operation is used, and what is the purpose of the checksum?
* How does Base58 encoding addresses some of the potential issues or limitations of Base64 encoding?
* Explain DER signature encoding with an example.
* Why does a transaction require a version, and what does it signify with respect to upgradability?
* How is the transaction fee determined, and why doesn't it have a dedicated field in the transaction structure?
* Explain different types of timelocks which you can have and list the components of the transactions that can be used to set timelocks.
* Why don't inputs specify the amount directly? How is the amount determined for each input?
* Why was the original idea for using the sequence and locktime fields for "high-frequency trades" considered insecure?

## Week 4: Chapter 6 (Script) + Chapter 7 (Transaction creation)

* What are non-standard output scripts? Give an example. Is there a way to use non-standard script on bitcoin network?
* What are OP_NOPs? Why do we have them in bitcoin? Why CLTV and CSV opcodes have to be succeeded with OP_DROP opcode? Will other OP_NOPs also have to be followed by OP_DROP?
* What should be the state of the stack after a script execution? What is clean stack rule and why is it important? Is it a policy rule or consensus rule?
* What are the different components of the transaction? Discuss each of them briefly. Discuss the changes in transaction structure before and after segwit upgrade.
* Discuss different Sighash types along with their usecases. Which part of the transaction is hashed in each sighash type?

## Week 5: Chapter 8 (P2SH) + Chapter 13 (Segwit)

* Why was P2SH proposed, and what were its benefits over bare complex scripts?
* How was P2SH activated, and when? Was it a soft fork or a hard fork?
* Describe briefly the P2SH script execution mechanism.
* Describe briefly the P2SH signature validation mechanism.
* Discuss the signature verification process for multisig. Why all multisig transactions have a dummy value (OP_0) at the beginning of the unlocking script? Why would fixing this be a hard fork?
* Why does the P2SH script hash 160 bits instead of the regular 256 bits hashes? Can this have any security issues for P2SH scripts?
* Why do we encode addresses in base58 instead of base64? Discuss advantages of bech32 over base58 encoding format.
* What was the major changes introduced in the Segwit upgrade? Why is it called Segregated Witness?
* Define transaction malleability. Explain how SegWit fixes transactional malleability. Why was it important to fix this issue?
* What are the two major SegWit address types, and what is the main difference between them?
* How was Segwit activated as a soft fork? How would non-segwit nodes process a Segwit transaction?
* Highlight the differences between native segwit and nested segwit? Which is better? Why nested segwit was required? Discuss script execution of nested segwit scripts.
* What are the differences between P2SH and P2WSH? Which is better in terms of security and why?
